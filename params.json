{"name":"So ruby chat","tagline":"miscellanea for the Stack Overflow Ruby chat room","body":"Welcome to the [Stack Overflow (SO) Ruby Chat Room][2].  This is a\r\nroom where we hang out to talk about Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails and other\r\nthings.  Our main purpose isn't to answer Ruby questions (that's what\r\nSO is for), but we try to help when we can.\r\n\r\n# General behavior\r\n\r\n* Be good to each other: [NCoC][1] (warning: some language)\r\n\r\n* Please keep language safe for work\r\n\r\n* Please don't use @username notification unless you are already in a\r\n  conversation with that person.\r\n\r\n* We believe that the Ruby chatroom should be a friendly and welcoming\r\n  place.  If you see misbehavior in the room, please @contact a room\r\n  owner and we'll do our best to sort it out.\r\n\r\n# Asking Questions\r\n\r\n* You don't need to ask if anyone is around.  Just ask your question\r\n  and someone will help if they are able.\r\n\r\n* You may link to questions on SO.  If someone knows the answer, they\r\n  will help.\r\n\r\n* If nobody answers, please don't repeat your request.\r\n\r\n* You may post short snippets of code into the room.  If it's big\r\n  (say, over a dozen lines) please post a link to the code instead.\r\n\r\n* Please format code appropriately: paste your text and indent it with\r\n  control-K.  Or you can press the \"fixed font\" button that appears\r\n  next to \"send\" and \"upload\" when your post is more than one line\r\n  line.\r\n\r\n* Don't star posts to reward users for answering your question.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://nocodeofconduct.com/ncoc","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
